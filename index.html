    <h1>Web designs i find interesting</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://visualizer.halowaypoint.com/">Halo 5 Guardians Comment Visualizer</a><p>Visualizing comments and social media posts as a time mapped 3D model is a really cool way to make reading internet content interesting and interactive. It would be really interesting to map content relating to different content to different sections of the 3D model.</p></li>
        <li><a href="http://swaywater.com/">Sway Water Bottling Co.</a><p>The design is clean and minamalist without seeming too modern or empty. I like the overlay at the beggining of the website although i wish it felt more like opening a product than just scrolling down.</p></li>
        <li><a href="http://squarepusher.net/">Square Pusher album site</a><p>I like the colors and how the website doesnt present you with very much info in one place which forces you to scroll and experience the visual scrolling effect. I like the visual feedback from scrolling but wished it seemed more like a glitch in the system and was something like screen tearing or pizilation. It would need to be subtle enough to not cause annoyance with prolonged use of the site.</p></li></ul>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
